# CS162

This repo contains all my assignments for CS162.

# Final Project
My final project is a really basic roguelike.

## Instructions
The goal of the game is to shoot as many zombies as possible. `f` to fire, and `r` to reload. You can also attack the zombies by walking into them, but it doesn't do a lot of damage.

## Requirements
    pip install bresenham

If you're running Windows, you will also need curses

    pip install windows-curses
    

## Running the game
You may need to make your terminal slightly bigger before the game will run correctly.

    git clone https://github.com/ayancey/CS162.git
    cd CS162
    python assignment_7_final.py
